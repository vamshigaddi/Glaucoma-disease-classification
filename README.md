# Glaucoma-disease-classification
## Overview
This repository contains the source code and documentation for a deep learning-based project aimed at detecting glaucoma from retinal fundus images. The project utilizes Pretrained model to analyze retinal images and classify them as either indicating the presence of "Referable Glaucoma" (RG) and "No Referable Glaucoma" (NRG) .

# Project Structure:
## Task Definition:

Binary classification of glaucoma images into RG and NRG categories. 
# Dataset:

Utilize the glaucoma dataset sourced from Kaggle.
# Model:

Employ the Xception pre-trained model for image classification.
# Dependencies:

Ensure necessary libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, and Matplotlib are installed.
# Preprocessing:

Normalize and resize images for model input.
# Data Augmentation:

Apply augmentation techniques to enhance dataset diversity.
# Model Training:

Fine-tune the Xception model on the training dataset.
# Evaluation:

Assess model performance using the test dataset and calculate test accuracy.
# Documentation:

Document project details, including methodology, results, and future improvements.
