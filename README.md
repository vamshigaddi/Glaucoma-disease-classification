# Glaucoma-disease-classification
## Overview
This repository contains the source code and documentation for a deep learning-based project aimed at detecting glaucoma from retinal fundus images. The project utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze retinal images and classify them as either indicating the presence of glaucoma or being normal.
